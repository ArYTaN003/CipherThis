        The Caesar Cipher, also known as a <span>shift cipher</span>, is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encrypting a message. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (which in cryptography is called the <span>plaintext</span>) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters shifted up or down in the alphabet. For each letter of the alphabet, you would take its <span>position</span> in the alphabet, say 3 for the letter ‘C’, and shift it by the key number. If we had a key of +3, that ‘C’ would be shifted down to an ‘F’ – and that same process would be applied to every letter in the plaintext. In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up in a form that cannot be understood at a simple glance. As unreadable as the resulting ciphertext may appear,<span>the Caesar Cipher is one of the weakest forms of encryption one can employ for the following reasons:</span>
        <br>
        <br>


        1)The key space is very small. Using a<span>Brute force attack method</span>, one could easily try all (25) possible combinations to decrypt the message without initially knowing the key. 
        <br><br>
        2)<span>The structure of the original plaintext remains intact. This makes the encryption method vulnerable to frequency analysis</span> – by looking at how often certain characters or sequences of characters appear, one can discover patterns and potentially discover the key without having to perform a full brute force search.
